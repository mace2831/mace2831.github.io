            <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
            <p>Throughout my journey in the Computer Science program at SNHU, I have had the opportunity to explore various facets
              of software engineering, from the fundamentals of programming to full-stack web applications and everything in between.
              I have designed simple console applications in Python, Java, and C++ and more complicated designs such as an embedded
              systems project utilizing the TI SimpleLink CC3200 micro controller. Creating a realistic looking scene in OpenGL
              challenged my expertise in C++ and reinforced  my understanding of computer graphics and advanced C++ programming concepts. </p>

            <p>All the projects significantly shaped my approach to problem solving and software development. By completing a wide range
              of projects – from console applications to complex embedded systems and graphical simulations – I have acquired a versatile
              skill set that allows me to adapt to different programming environments and challenges. Each project has reinforced programming
              fundamentals, creativity, attention to detail, and perseverance in software development.</p>

              <p>Each of these projects gave me hands on experience and equipped me with technical expertise needed to excel in a professional
                software development role. Whether debugging low-level code or creating full-stack applications, I have developed the skills
                and confidence to take on complex challenges and projects. Collaborating with professors and fellow students throughout this
                program offered me the opportunity to gain feedback and take constructive criticism to improve my designs. The professors took
                on the role of stakeholders in each class allowing me to opportunity to discuss the direction of the project with the end user. </p>

              <p>For my capstone project, I decided to take a Python JupyterDash project from CS-340 and turn it into a full-stack web application
                 using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js). This decision allowed me to take a simple project written in a
                 different language and use my knowledge of Python and JavaScript to transform it into a web application to highlight my skill in
                 software development and design. I added an autocomplete function to the search bar utilizing a Trie data structure to highlight
                 my knowledge and skill of algorithms and data structures. The final enhancement requirement was to focus on databases. Taking
                 courses on secure coding led me to design an administrator single page application to add authentication and authorization protocols
                 to protect the database as well as using MongoSanitize to sanitize input to mitigate injection attacks. The experience of transforming
                 the CS-340 project into a MEAN stack was incredibly rewarding and reinforced my understanding of key web development concepts like
                 RESTfulAPI design and practical experience in building applications that are ready for real-world deployment. The artifacts included
                 in my ePortfolio represent the diverse range of skills I have developed during my time in the Computer Science program at SNHU. This
                 portfolio serves as a testament to my readiness to contribute effective code in the field of computer science.</p>

                    <h3>Software Engineering and Design</h3>
                    <p>In this enhancement I converted the AnimalShelter project from CS-340 from a JupyterDash Python project to a
                       MEAN stack web application. I refactored the Python project to fit the MEAN stack and created the backend logic
                        as and Express application adding API endpoints and controllers to drive the backend logic. I created a Mongo
                        database to hold the various animal information and display it as a list with clickable rows to take the user
                        to the selected animal's detail page. The detail page displays the information of each animal and provides an
                        interactive map showing the location of the animal. I included this enhancment to demonstrate my knowledge of
                        Python, JavaScript, HTML, software development/design, fullstack web development, and databases. This enhnacement
                        aligns with the course objective 3 which demonstrates my ability to use well-founded and inovative techniques,
                        skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and
                        accomplish industry-specific goals. This was a fun but lengthy process because Express applications require a heavy
                        workload during initial development. I did not run into any issues while completing this first enhancement.

                    <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
                    <p>In this enhancement I further refined the AnimalShelter project two from CS-340 by adding a Trie data structure
                      to store the names of the animals in the database and offer suggestions based off of user input in the search bar.
                      adding the autocorrect function utilizing a Trie data structure demonstrates my knowlegdge of data structrues and
                      algorithms. Adding the autocomplete function involved creating the Trie class to define the data strucutre and the
                      autocomplete class to handle gathering the data from the database. Connecting the data to the front end of the
                      application I utilized JQuery to grab the data from the Trie and autocomplete classes to offer suggested names based
                      on the user input and the names of the animals in the database. This enhancement aligns with course outcomes number
                      3 and 4 which are designing and evaluating computing solutions that solve a given problem while demonstrating an
                      ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques to deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. This
                      was an incredible learning experience for me as I had no prior experience with JQuery or Trie structures. I was able
                      to utilzie articles from GeeksForGeeks and Stackoverflow to help solve issues that popped up during development.</p>

            <div class="project">
              <div>
                  <h3>Databases</h3>
                  <p>In this artifact I further refined the AnimalShelter project two from CS-340 by completing the single page administrator
                     application that limits database manipulation to only authorized users. I added this artifact into my ePortfolio to show
                     my ability to create a secure web application that protects data in the database while allowing users to safely view the
                     information. This enhancement clearly showcases my security mindset by anticipating security breaches and mitigating
                     vulnerabilites. The Trie data structure from the second enhancement that is used for the autocomplete function prevents
                     any sort of injection attack to the database as the interaction with the database is done without user input. When taking
                     in the username from the user Mongoose sanitize is used to sanitize the input to remove threats from injection attacks. On
                     the administration page the buttons that allow the user to manipulate the data in the database only become visible when a
                     valid user and JWT certificate are verified. The course outcomes that align with this enhancement are 3 and 5 and
                     demonstrated my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions that sove a given problem as well as show my security
                     mindset by anticipating exploits and mitigate those vulnerabilities through the implementation of data sanitization and user
                     authorization and authentication. This process was easier than adding the autocomplete functionality
                     because I have created a single page application administrator page before. Adding in the data sanitization through Mongoose
                     sanitize was an easy process, but a good learning experience.</p>
